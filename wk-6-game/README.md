 # # Week-6 Project Tic-tac-toe.

#   Instruction

* Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows a player to play against a computer.

#   Game Details
Tic-Tac-Toe is basically a two man game where you try to beat your opponent by matching three boxes out of the nine provided boxes, and the other tries to block your move while trying to beat you too.

#   Requirements

1. There should be a welcome view that shows a welcome, statement, the game instructions, and gives the user a choice of playing with X or O against the computer.
2. The Tic-Taco-Toe game should be played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
3. There should be a way to display "win" for the first player who gets 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally)
4. When all 9 squares are full, and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game should end in a tie.
5. If a player wins or the game ties, there should be a way to play again or reset the game.
6. There should be a way to keep track of the scores between a player and the computer.
